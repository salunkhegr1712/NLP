The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms.The atmospheric pressure at Earth is sea level averages 101.325 kPa 14.696 psi, with a scale height of about A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084 nitrogen, 20.946 oxygen, 0.934 argon, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules. Water vapor content varies between 0.01 and 4Once upon a time there was a crow lived in a jungle. The crow was black which you know is black as coal.
