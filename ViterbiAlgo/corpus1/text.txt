Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water.
About 71% of Earth is surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth is polar ice, lakes, and rivers.
The remaining 29% of Earth is surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth is surface layer
is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and
earthquakes. Earth liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth magnetosphere, deflecting
destructive solar winds.
Earth atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide CO2
trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere and forms 
clouds that cover most of the planet. More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is 
redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. A region is climate is governed by latitude, but also by elevation
and proximity to moderating oceans. In most areas severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and 
heatwaves, occurs and greatly impacts life.
